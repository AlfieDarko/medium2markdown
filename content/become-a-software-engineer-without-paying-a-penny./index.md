Still assuming you need a degree, or to spend £££ on code boot camps or need work experience to get in the game? **Fake news!**

The coding boot camp game is changing. There are so much untapped revenue streams in the education sector and charging upfront is not the best way to do this. A lot of boot camps are experimenting with how to offer their courses for free or very cheap to prospective customers.   
**Education is a seriously lucrative business**. Everybody is racking their heads over how to take a slice in the big higher education pie. From buy-now-pay-later models, charging your prospective employees for your new expertise, apprenticeships to corporate training for staff who want to retrain as software devs in that company.

### How I got in?

I’ll keep it brief. I was on twitter when a former  [**Makers Academy**](https://makers.tech) Bootcamp student tweeted about limited fellowship (**fully-paid for!**) places for prospective students from underrepresented backgrounds. I didn’t even know what a coding boot camp was at the time but since I was in the middle of learning how to code anyway, I felt like this was worth trying out.  
Long story short, I applied & done the lengthy course pre-requisites. Completed the interview process, done the course and got a software development job in the end. All in the space of around 6 months, my life really changed quite drastically.

### Is That The Only Way?

Nope. In fact, there are multiple other boot camps that offer similar things for eg.

[**Founders & Coders**](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) do a totally free 4-month coding boot camp (Providing you pass the interview and course-prerequisites).

[**School of Code**](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/)  (Birmingham, UK), do a similar scheme.

[**CodeNation**](https://wearecodenation.com/) (Manchester, UK) privately offer bursaries and scholarships to who they feel deserves so (Don’t ask, don’t get!)

[**Lambda School**](https://lambdaschool.com/eu/)  is about to open up to UK and EU students (A 30-week online course). They get their money from a percentage of your wages only when you get a job.

[**Flat Iron School**](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/london/#tuition-financing-scholarships)  have something not free but you can defer payment until you have a job (Although you have to put down £500 at the start, and £500 at the end of the course, so not so free but It's worth mentioning, none the less). They also have a free online course prep if you want to get a structured headstart.

If you are Shakespeare with the pen, draft an email up to a list of boot-camps, telling them your plight, demonstrating your determination & showing your initiative. You never know what might happen, many places do offer people full scholarships privately.

### But Can’t I Learn All This At Home?

Yes, you can. In fact, I would encourage most people to do so, that’s how I started. We are in the age of information, and literally, everything that is taught is available online. If you are self-motivated, determined and disciplined, you can easily do it. For the duration of your career, most of the things you will learn will be at home anyway, so best to get into that habit nice and early!

Another good thing about learning at home is you can do it at your own pace. If you don’t get something, you can just revisit it again and again until you get it. Somethings take a long time to sink in & there’s nowhere better to feel momentarily stupid than at home when nobody can see you. **_Nobody ‘affi know…_**

Bootcamp courses are super intense and move very, very, very quickly. If you have part-time/full-time obligations & couldn’t afford to put your life on pause for that period…

![**“it’s a little bit of a sticky one, still.”**](./asset-2.jpeg)

For many people, the opportunity cost of not being able to work full-time in that period may be too great to do so. At home, it might take more than the 3–4 months they advertise how long their courses are, to learn the material but if you enjoy learning in the comfort of your own home without paying a penny, that outweighs everything else.

How I was learning at home was by looking at boot camps GitHub profiles and their websites for their curriculums and was s̵t̵e̵a̵l̵i̵n̵g̵ going through most of it myself, with google and youtube to help me.

The only disadvantage would be that you may not have the experience of working with somebody or pairing on code problems although that’s totally not true. There are organizations where you can go and work with a real human being or two, such as:

[**CodeBar**](https://codebar.io/) has very frequent workshops where you are encouraged to pair and work through the curriculum on their site.

[**Flat Iron School**](https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-London-Coding-Community/events/past/) do a regular pizza & code sessions   
& workshops so you can work on things with people if you want to. All totally free. (100% free pizza too).

[**Black Girls Tech**](https://blackgirl.tech/) have workshops aimed at black women and non-binary people where you can have a chance to work on code with people!

There are so many things like this, just have a look through Eventbrite or Meetup.com, all these workshops usually dish out **free pizza**. If that is not an incentive, what is?

Hopefully, I’ve opened your eyes to some ways to utilize the offerings of the community and different organizations to get into software development as a career. Make sure you [give back](https://codebar.io/coaches) when you finally get your foot in the doors too!
